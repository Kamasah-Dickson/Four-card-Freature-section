created 2rows and 3columns.
box1 spaned 1/3 rows
box2's row 1/2 and colummn 2/3
box3's row 2/3 and colummn 2/3
and box 4 also spaned 1/3rows and took the last column.

### What I learned
How to implement the CSS grid column span. Looking at the design at first, I could not even think of what
Grid property I was supposed to use here. But after some practices i did I was able to 
expand my pespective towards designing considering the use of CSS Grid.
